                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Right now there are a variety of factors
                    slowing our opening, however, we plan on
                    opening as soon as is reasonably possible,
                    but we don't have an exact date planned.
                    Currently we are working on perfecting the
                    flavors we plan to serve, and setting some paperwork and
                    liscensure.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; We will actually have a contest each month
                    to submit a new flavor of the month. At the 
                    end of each year we will review each flavor
                    of the month and decide if any should be
                    moved to our permanent menu. When one of those 
                    flavors is added to the menu the person who 
                    suggested it will receive a $50 gift card for 
                    It's Truckin' Real: Rolled Ice Cream and
                    cocao. We hope that we can get some of the community
                    involved in choosing the flavors that they would enjoy!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;We will actually be at Porter Park at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM on weekdays.
                    We will be operating like a traditional ice cream truck outside of that, so we will 
                    try to drive around various residential zones as well, preferably at a time of day 
                    that won't make people angry. Over time we will come up with a more concrete route,
                    but we do have to ask most apartments if they are ok with us coming through their
                    parking lot, or being in a specific spot near them for a while so that people from
                    their buildings have easy access to our ice cream. Hopefully we can get that approved
                    so that we can bring our delicious ice cream straight to you!
