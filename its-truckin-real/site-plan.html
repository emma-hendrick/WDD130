      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
          
        Think about the last time you bought ice cream. Did they do anything wrong that you noticed? One thing that we noticed that other businesses aren't
        always great at is presentation, and taking care of their employees. At It's Truckin' Real, we make Thai stir fried ice cream to brighten everyone's 
        day! We also ensure that our employees are payed well, as happy employees make better ice cream. The goal of our website is to bring in new 
        customers, and to let customers know that we are available for catering. We also plan to create an employee portal with useful resources for them 
        to use.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our intended audience includes people who are interested in seeing our current menu of flavors to choose from, and potential clients
        who are looking into our catering options. Our intended audience consists of people in Rexburg, Idaho, and surrounding areas. We aim to 
        cater to an audience from around 16-30 with our website, as these will primarily be the people who are interested in our catering options,
        or who decide to look up our menu in advance.
