Think about the last time you bought ice cream. Did they do anything wrong that you noticed? One thing that we noticed that other businesses aren't
always great at is presentation, and taking care of their employees. At It's Truckin' Real, we make Thai stir fried ice cream to brighten everyone's 
day! We also ensure that our employees are payed well, as happy employees make better ice cream. The goal of our website is to bring in new 
customers, and to let customers know that we are available for catering. We also plan to create an employee portal with useful resources for them 
to use.
